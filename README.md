# 🏆 About the Project
This project was built as part of my coding journey intrest . The platform demonstrates my ability to build a full-stack application with key features such as user authentication, CRUD functionality, and a dynamic comments system.<br/>
and during building this project i learn a lot like user auhtentication and auhterization and building scalable mongoose schemma and connection between multiple schemas.
